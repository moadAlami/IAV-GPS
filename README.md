# IAV-GPS
Preparing GPS files to be used in Google Earth\
Written in Python 3.6

The goal behind this project is to define the projection of three different shapefiles:
    
	PTOPO18 : Topographic Points
    LAMP18: Lampe
    REG18: Regard
	
These points have been collected in the IAV using a GPS. The projection used is :
    
	Lambert Conformal Conique-Morocco Zone 1

The professor forgot to give us the projection files, so i had to define the projection and reproject it to a projection that in order to display it properly in on top of Google Earth Pro.\
The procedure is as follows :

    1- Make a backup for everything in the directory
    2- Define the projection for the three shapefiles
    3- Reproject the datasets to WGS 84
    4- Plot the original files and the re-projected ones
